# DTTPHackathon-Chef65

## Description
This project leverages AI as a recipe generator to address time constraints and the desire for culinary diversity. The objective is to provide busy individuals with quick and varied recipes tailored to the ingredients in their fridge, aiming to minimize both cooking time and food waste.

## Technology
This task deployed a combination of Html,Css,Javascript. We also deployed a free, fast, and reliable CDN for react-toastify which enables the app to fetch various recipes each time you input your food class and click on generate receipt. This was done by registering an API key whihc enables the codes to work smoothly.
